linkedin,"Say Hello to A2A: The Future of AI Agent Collaboration

Google just introduced the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, and it’s a big leap forward in how AI agents interact and work together.

If you’re familiar with MCP (Model Context Protocol), you know it allowed apps to send structured context to LLMs — kind of like plugging your app directly into an AI brain.

A2A takes it further. It enables AI agents themselves to communicate, coordinate, and collaborate across different systems using a shared, open protocol.
What’s even more exciting? Over 50 companies, including big names like Google , Cohere ,SAP,Cognizant,Capgemini ,Infosys, Replit ,LangChain ,Atlassian and more, have come together to support and contribute to this open standard.

A2A means:
Agents speak the same language using structured message formats (roles, content types, IDs)

Cross-platform compatibility for multi-agent workflows

Real interoperability across AI ecosystems

linkedin,"Are Indian Startups overhyped? Is there any innovation really happening through Indian startups? Why are we lacking v/s China?

""📺 The Prime Time show 'Debate with Arnab' on hashtag#RepublicTV 📺"" 

We discussed these topics on the show and as part of panel representing founder's viewpoint, I didn't realize the big responsibility upon us - To express our point of view strongly, while maintaining optimism and conviction amidst all the negativity around the subject.

The show opened on a provocative note 💣 , with startups labeled as hashtag#scams, founders branded as hashtag#frauds, and VC investments dismissed as money laundering schemes. Despite the harsh narrative, the founders on the panel remained composed and asserted that such generalizations overlook the broader reality - a few out-of-context examples, referred without ascertaining facts, do not define the entire startup universe. We emphasized the genuine hashtag#innovation emerging from Indian startups, as well as the structural challenges they face (see clip)

To continue the narrative, I strongly believe that driving a radical transformation in deep tech innovation requires a strong alliance between the government, corporates, and academia - one that offers patient capital, supportive policy frameworks, and access to advanced research. This collaborative effort can empower founders to take bold, unconventional, and future-facing risks. 🚀

P.P.S - Had a great chat with hashtag#ArnabGoswami post the show. Found him very different from onscreen persona - warm, forthcoming and definitely not loud :-)

linkedin,"Startup Mahakumbh – An Experience to Remember!

Today was special. I walked into Startup Mahakumbh – Bharat Innovates, not knowing what to expect. But the moment I stepped in, I felt the energy. Ideas were flowing, people were excited, and every corner had a story.

I met founders who spoke about their startups with so much passion that you could feel their belief. I saw investors listening closely, looking for the next big thing. And in between, there were people like me—curious, inspired, and just soaking it all in.


The best part? The real, raw conversations. Not just about success, but also the struggles—the risks, the failures, the moments of doubt. Because that’s what building something truly takes.

I left the event with more than just connections. I left with inspiration, new ideas, and a reminder that big things start with small steps.

Thanks to WebMobril Inc., Rajeev Saxena and I got to experience Startup Mahakumbh firsthand—connecting with innovators and witnessing how technology is shaping the future

Were you there too? What was your favorite moment? Let’s talk! 🚀

linkedin,"Leadership.
What does it actually mean?

It’s navigating through uncertainty with confidence and intention.
Leadership is about direction — leadership is about SERVING, not controlling; true leaders never micromanage.

It’s not about when you get there, but how you get there — with your leader supporting You.
The journey is about You.
The journey defines You.

Trust and being trusted - always a two way street; that’s leadership at its core.

Pick a good leader.

It’s easy to tell people what to do, but leading by example is where true leadership lies. The best leaders set the standard through their actions, not just their words.

linkedin,"Interviews are all about the details! ❗️ Every nuance of a candidate’s response—tone, word choice, stories, even the questions they ask you—can reveal their true potential. Look beyond the resume; ask the right questions to uncover problem-solving skills and cultural fit.

Top 3 tips: 
1) Probe for real examples, not hypotheticals. 
2) Watch for passion—it’s a sign of engagement. 
3) Test adaptability with curveball questions.

linkedin,"Have you ever been in an interview that felt more like catching up with an old friend? That’s exactly how it felt last week.

The conversation flowed so naturally and it wasn’t an interrogation, just a genuine, lively chat. 

The interviewer exuded kindness and gentleness. It made the whole experience feel effortless."
linkedin,"Work Culture: The Heartbeat of Every Organization

👉🏻Work culture isn’t one-size-fits-all. What thrives at ""Company A"" might look completely different at ""Company B"". Some prioritize flexibility, others focus on collaboration, while some champion innovation at every turn. 

But here’s the truth: a strong work culture isn’t just about perks or policies—it’s about the values, behaviors, and people that shape everyday experiences. 

For me the best work culture is there where a company prioritizes the want of the employees and makes them happy in every single way. 

'Working should be fun not a burden' ✌🏻

What’s the work culture like at your organization? I’d love to hear how it’s shaping your experience. 

hashtag#WorkCulture hashtag#Leadership hashtag#CompanyValues hashtag#linkedinguide"
linkedin,"!!Why Culture Matters More Than We Think!!

A great workplace isn’t just about targets and deadlines. It’s about learning, bonding, and having open conversations.

-If we stop learning, we stop growing.
-If we don’t bond, we work in silos.
-If we can’t speak freely, we miss out on great ideas, valuable learning, and even basic presentation skills.

The best teams aren’t just smart; they share knowledge/knowledge transfer is an everyday thing, trust each other, and create a space where everyone feels heard.

Because when people learn together, grow together, and think together, success follows.

Does your workplace have this culture?

linkedin,"Founders are delusional. And babies look like aliens.



Had a great conversation this morning with my friend William Toussaint about his solution that’s going to change the golf industry.

My best advice?

Find someone to call your baby ugly and validate your delusion.

You’re building something that doesn’t exist.
You’re selling a vision nobody asked for. Yet.
You’re pitching V1 like it’s a rocket ship, knowing full well it’s held together by duct tape and caffeine.

And still, you believe.

You have to be a little bit delusional to be a great founder.
But you also have to be honest enough to admit when your baby’s not quite ready for the photo album. 

That’s where the magic is bold belief with brutal honesty.

Build the thing.

Fix the weird-looking parts.

Keep going.
